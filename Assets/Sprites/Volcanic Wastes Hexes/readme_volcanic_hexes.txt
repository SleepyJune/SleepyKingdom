Last Update: v1.0 in December 2017

Description:
Hand-painted terrain hex tiles of volcanoes, lava fields, fumaroles, ash plains, and burned forests! Use these to enliven your RPG overworld, strategy games, boardgame visuals, or whatever you can imagine.

- 8 tile types x 4 variations = 32 tiles total
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that trees can overlap the tiles behind
- includes 30 decor overlay sprites (rocks, trees, lava cones, fumaroles)

Terrain types included:
- volcanoes, active
- volcanoes, dormant
- lava fields
- lava field, active
- ash plains
- fumarole fields
- ash plains, burned trees
- dirt plains, burned trees

Do note that this does not actually require any particular version of Unity, you can use it in pretty much any application. This is a tilesheet saved as a png and split and named into sprites. There are also individual hex tiles in a separate folder if that's how you roll.

As a new thing I'm trying out, there are _also_ a few random terrain decor sprites you can plop on top of tiles to add a little variation. I'll probably make these for all of my terrain sets if people find them useful. 

Usage:
These terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, shrubs, etc. will appear to stand out and over the tiles 'behind' them.

Future:
If these prove popular, I may wish to do further hexes to add to this set, and further types of tilesets like this. I do have a passion for terrain tiles, after all. So drop me a line if you've got something particular in mind.
