Last Update: v1.0 in December 2017

Description:
Hand-painted terrain hex tiles of tropical jungle, sandy palm forests, swamps, wetlands, and bogs! Use these to enliven your RPG overworld, strategy games, boardgame visuals, or whatever you can imagine.

- 9 tile types x 4 variations = 36 tiles total
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that trees can overlap the tiles behind

Terrain types included:
- bog
- sand
- sand with palm forest
- grassy sand
- grassy sand with palm forest
- tropical plains
- tropical jungle (tropical plains with trees)
- wetlands
- swamp (wetlands with trees)

Do note that this does not actually require any particular version of Unity, you can use it in pretty much any application. This is a tilesheet saved as a png and split and named into sprites. There are also individual tiles in a separate folder if that's how you roll.

Usage:
These hexagonal terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, shrubs, etc. will appear to stand out and over the tiles 'behind' them.

Future:
If these prove popular, I may wish to do further hexes to add to this set, and further types of tilesets like this. I do have a passion for terrain tiles, after all. So drop me a line if you've got something particular in mind.
